# node-libgpiod-examples

this repo holds cool sample code to show what is possible to do with
[node-libgpiod](https://github.com/sombriks/node-libgpiod)

## Configuring gpio-sim

Run the bash script as root if you plan to use the examples on hardware without
real GPIO:

```bash
sudo sh prepare-gpio-sim.sh
```
